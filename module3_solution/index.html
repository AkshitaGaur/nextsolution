 A typical desert vegetable, Ker Sangri is a kind of a pickle. This tangy side dish goes well with Bajra roti.t is a Rajasthani delicacy that is made using dried Ker Berries and Sangri Beans. Just a few hours of soaking these berries/beans in water and then it is cooked along with curd and everyday masalas. Each and every household has its own way of making it. The Ker Sangri Recipe is a traditional Rajasthani dish that is made from with a combination of dried beans and berries that are grown locally in Rajasthan. It is often made into a spicy dry vegetable, but,have added a little bit of sweetness to the spice and the taste was delectable. If you plan to make it , do first try it without the jaggery and then add jaggery to find the difference. The addition if raisins to the sabzi adds to the richness of Ker Sangri. At home we served it along with a Kadhi, Phulkas and Steamed Rice and not to forget the ghee that had along with.</p>

Badam is the Indian name for Almonds. The almond is a native to the Mediterranean climate region of the Middle East, eastward as far as the Indus. It was spread by humans in ancient times along the shores of the Mediterranean into northern Africa and southern Europe and more recently transported to other parts of the world, notably California, United States. Almonds are a rich source of vitamin E and proteins. Hence its always suggested that daily about 7 to 8 almonds soaked overnight peeled and eaten early morning is very nutritious and healthy too. While the almond is often eaten on its own, raw or toasted, it is also a component of various dishes.

Sweet almonds are used in marzipan, many pastries, cookies (including French macarons, macaroons), cakes and other sweets and desserts. Almonds are used in a popular dessert where they are mixed with milk and then served hot.</p>
